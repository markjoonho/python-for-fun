    "\n",
    "There are n people with numbers from 1 to n doing English Endings game. English endings are conducted according to the following rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Beginning with number 1, say the words one by one in number order.\n",
    "2. After the last person has spoken the word, it starts again at number 1.\n",
    "3. You must say words that start with the last letter of the word spoken by the previous person.\n",
    "4. Words that have appeared previously cannot be used.\n",
    "5. Single letter words are not accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following shows a situation where 3 people talk to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "tank → kick → know → wheel → land → dream → mother → robot → tank\n",

    "The ending above proceeds as follows.\n",

    "- Person 1 says tank on his first turn.\n",
    "- Person 2 says kick on his first turn.\n",
    "- Person 3 says know on his first turn.\n",
    "- Person 1 says wheel on his second turn.\n",
    "- (Continue on)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you continue to do the ending, the word tank that person 3 spoke on his third turn is a word that appeared before, so it will be eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the number of people n and the words words spoken by people in order are given as parameters, complete the solution function so that the number of the first person to drop out and the number of times that person is eliminated are returned.\n",

    "- You don't have to worry about the meaning (meaning) of the words used for ending.\n",
